# Write a program that provides a weather alert. Make sure your program does the following:
# Set the temperature to be a variable.
# Use either an IF statement or a SWITCH statement to determine what type of advisory to give for the temperature variable.
# If the temperature is 90 degrees or above, the program alerts a heat advisory
# If the temperature is 80 - 90, the program alerts a heat warning
# Do for three more levels of temperatures.

```

    console.log("Heat Warning: It's warm outside. Drink plenty of water and take necessary precautions.");
} else if (temperature >= 70 && temperature < 80) {
    console.log("Moderate Temperature: Enjoy the pleasant weather!");
