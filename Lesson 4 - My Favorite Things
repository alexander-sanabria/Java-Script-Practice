# First, create a JavaScript program that defines, as an array, a list of 10 of your favorite things.
# Then, using any loop that you wish (i.e. for, forEach, do/while, etc) print each item from the array to the console.
# Lastly, with the same script, add an if statement to test if you are on item #3, if so, print out "Wonderful, made it to item 3!", and then continue with the loop as normal.

```
console.log("Script 1: Printing favorite things using forEach");
var favoriteThings = [
  "Reading",
  "Traveling",
  "Coding",
  "Hiking",
  "Listening to Music",
  "Photography",
  "Trying New Foods",
  "Watching Movies",
  "Playing Video Games",
  "Spending Time with Family"
];
favoriteThings.forEach(function (thing, index) {
  console.log("Item " + (index + 1) + ": " + thing);
});
console.log("\nScript 2: Adding if statement to check for item #3 using forEach");
favoriteThings.forEach(function (thing, index) {
  if (index === 2) {
    console.log("Wonderful, made it to item 3!");
  }
  console.log("Item " + (index + 1) + ": " + thing);
});
```
