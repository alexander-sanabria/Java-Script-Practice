// You can create a random number using the following:
// var randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random()*10)+1
// This create a random number between one and ten. Change the "10" to "12" and you create a random number between 1 and 12. Make sense?
// Write a program that prompts the user for a number.
// Then, generate a random number between 1 and 10, and multiple the users number with this new number that you just created.
// Output the new number you created by multiplying the user number and your random number to user using a prompt and ask them what they think your random number is.
// Evaluate the user input. If they are right, indicate that in an alert. If they are wrong, indicate that and provide the correct answer in an alert.

```
var userNumber = parseFloat(prompt("Enter a number:"));
var randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;
var result = userNumber * randomNumber;
var userGuess = parseFloat(prompt("What is " + userNumber + " multiplied by the random number?"));
if (userGuess === result) {
    alert("Correct! The result is " + result);

    alert("Incorrect! The correct answer is " + result);
